            <h2>Did You Know?</h2>

            <li class='popstuff'>The first customers to buy Epsicles were Epperson’s classmates.</li>
            <li class='popstuff'>Popsicles originally came in seven flavors thought to be root beer, cherry, lemon,
                orange, banana,
                grape, and watermelon, but there is no official record of Epperson’s original flavors.</li>
            <li class='popstuff'>The earliest known popsicles date as far back as 1872. Back then, a popsicle was called
                a Hokey-Pokey.
            <li class='popstuff'>Popsicles are also known as freezer pops, ice lollies, and ice pops.</li>
